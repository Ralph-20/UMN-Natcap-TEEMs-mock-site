# University of Minnesota: Domains and Branding Guidelines

## umn.edu Domain Requirements

All official University websites must be hosted on the umn.edu domain. Any unit conducting **official University business** must host their website(s) on umn.edu. Official University business is defined as:

- The majority of the unit's projects or activities are funded by the U of M
- Staff or students are employees of the U of M
- Activities take place in U of M buildings using U of M resources

### Vanity URLs

Units may purchase a vanity URL for marketing purposes, but must forward that URL to their site on the umn.edu domain. Units may not forward their umn.edu address to an outside domain.

## Sponsorships or Collaborations

If possible, websites that have outside entities as sponsors or collaborators should be set up on the umn.edu domain if the University is the lead in the collaboration.

**Important restriction**: Sites cannot be hosted on the umn.edu domain unless they use the University's web header and footer.

If using the University's web header and footer is unacceptable to other entities in the collaboration, the website should be hosted elsewhere.

### Collaborative Sites Outside umn.edu

Sites created outside the umn.edu domain in sponsorship or collaboration with entities outside the University must consult with University Marketing Communications on the use of the University's marks or web headers and footers.

University units engaged in a collaboration or sponsorship may use the Wordmark to show the U's affiliation if required by the written agreement with the other party. Contact University Marketing Communications for guidelines in using the Wordmark on collaborative sites.

## Outside Domains (.com, .org, .net, etc.)

An outside domain may be used by units to host a website in the following circumstances:

- The site is part of a collaboration with other universities or entities
- Researchers are communicating about work that is not affiliated with the University

Units that manage an outside domain meeting these stipulations must consult with University Marketing Communications before using University's marks or web headers and footers.

**Note**: Sites outside the umn.edu domain are not included in the University's website search results.

## URL Masking

Units that work with outside vendors to establish a software as a service (SAAS) relationship should use URL masking, if possible.

URL masking allows an official University website (e.g., employment.umn.edu) to be set up on an outside domain but appear to be on the umn.edu domain to allow for official branding.

### Technical Requirements for URL Masking

- The outside domain vendor must be able to support these hostnames
- The University's domain name system (DNS) servers must contain one or more entries describing the relationship between the umn.edu hostname and the vendor's systems

Contact your unit's IT staff for help with this process.
